this is just me doing dumb stuff on my september semester hope my teacher like it

1. the first file (introduction): most of them are bootstrap and vuejs learning for the frontend

it's quite similar with my assignment 2
(and yah i'm slightly dyslexic so most of my code are checked by AI for the better result. but i still wanna try my best)
